# shortPathCities
Test using algorithm to find the shorter path between some cities in the world
The problem to join some cities with the shorter path possible is a typical problem to dijkstra algorithm.
The sample data is inthe cities.txt file.
The proble to solve is join some cities, nodes, with the shorter path possible. The distance, weight, between to cioties is the same independently the way.
This is a Dijkstra's problem. Every step in the travel affect to the graph adding more restriction
At the begining every node is accesible from the the others but we can visit just one time every city.
